      <h1>Java</h1>
<p>Java reduces costs, shortens developer timeframes, drives innovation, and improves
  application services as the programming language of choice for enterprise architecture,
  finance, and HR.</p>
  <p>Java is used in many industries including manufacturing, automotive,
  insurance, and public sector.</p>
  <h3>The main features of Java are:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Object oriented</li>
    <li>Inheritance</li>
    <li>Polymorphism</li>
    <li>Portability</li>
    <li>Robust</li>
  </ul>

    class HelloWorldApp {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello World!");
      }

      <h1>JavaScript</h1>
      <p>JavaScript is a scripting language developed to
         enable Web authors to design interactive sites. It is compatible
         with most modern browsers.</p>
         <p> JavaScript shares features and structures of the
         full Java language, but was developed
        independently. It can interact with HTML source code, which enables dynamic content.</p>
        <code>
          function myFunc(a, b) {
            return a * b;
        }
        document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = myFunc(4, 3);

    <section class="main-section" id="scala">
      <h1>Scala</h1>
      cala  is a general-purpose programming language providing
      support for functional programming and a strong static type system.</p>
      <p> Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions aimed to address criticisms of Java.</p>
   <code>
    / Scala: Direct conversion from Java

    // no import needed; scala.math
    // already imported as `math`
    def mathFunction(num: Int): Int = {
      var numSquare: Int = num*num
      return (math.cbrt(numSquare) + math.log(numSquare)).
        asInstanceOf[Int]
    }
   </code>
    </section>

<section class="main-section" id="c++">
   <h1>C++</h1>
   <p>C++  is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup
     as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".</p>
     <p>The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic,
      and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p>
   <code>
    #include
    using namespace std;
    int main () {
      cout << "Hello World!";
      return 0;
    }
   </code>

<section class="main-section" id="python">
    <h1>Python</h1>
 <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[28]

  Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library</p>
     <code>
      words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
      for w in words:
          print w, len(w)
